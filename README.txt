BASIC LANDING PAGE
==================

Thanks for downloading this repo, that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript

It's pretty simple but will allow you to improve your adquired knowledge in web development and put the theory into practice.
In fact, this is the landing page I made for my personal website gazabache.com nowadays.

Thanks to AlexCG Design, who helped to make this project through his youtube channel.

Regards,
 
Gerson.
